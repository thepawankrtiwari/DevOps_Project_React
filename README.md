## Learning Approach, You can follow:

1. **Identify the Problem Statement** 🧐
   - Start by understanding what you need to solve. Clearly define the problem or task at hand.

2. **Begin Implementation** 🚀
   - Start working on the problem right away. Hands-on practice is crucial for learning.

3. **Acknowledge Gaps in Knowledge** 🤔
   - Recognize that it’s normal not to know everything from the start. Accept that gaps in knowledge will occur.

4. **Break the Problem into Manageable Steps** 🧩
   - Divide the problem into smaller, more manageable parts. This helps in tackling each part individually.

5. **Learn and Implement** 📚🔧
   - **Learn How to Solve Each Step:**
     - **Watch Videos** 🎥: Look for video tutorials that explain the concepts or steps you need to follow.
     - **Read Articles** 📝: Find and read articles that provide detailed explanations and insights.
   - **Implement** 💻: Apply what you've learned by working on the problem step-by-step.

6. **Add Complexity Gradually** 🔍
   - Once you have successfully implemented the basic solution, introduce additional complexity or new features to enhance the solution.

7. **Repeat the Process** 🔄
   - Go back to step 1 and repeat the process with new problems or more advanced aspects of the current problem. This iterative approach helps in deepening your understanding and skills.


By focusing on these key areas and avoiding common pitfalls, you'll build a strong foundation for a successful DevOps career.
